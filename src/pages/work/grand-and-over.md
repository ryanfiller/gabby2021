# Grand and Over

## Challenge/Goals

To create an auto-biographical piece based on a memory.

## Approach

As an hommage to my late grandparents, I chose to reflect on the time I spent as a child visiting their  home. After spending some time ruminating on these memories, I crafted a story with the intetion of capturing the feeling of physically being in a space that I will never be able to visit or experience again â€” while maintaining something that feels distinctly separate from reality and almost otherwordly as if you were looking in on a dream. This strategy also plays into the ambiguity of memories and how they can be imprecise and may even change over time. 

## Inspiration 

The hazy idea of memories....... inspired......

## Strategy & Solution

In order to capture the dream-like, ambiguous quality of memories, I chose to use a maze-book format for my auto-bigraphical piece. This format helps further emphasize the meandering and often muddled sensation of trying to remember small details about things that happened a very long time ago. The use of a monochromatic blue color scheme gives the artwork a calm, tranquil feeling that also comes off as a bit somber - as many memories are things we often can never experience again, especially when they are about people who are no longer with us. 

Finally, sharing the story through the use of handlettering also enforces the themes of the unreliability of memory while also emphasizing key themes, or the things that stick out most in our minds.  

This pieces was executed using Adobe Photoshop, and the final maze-book format folds in a zig-zagging pattern down into one small square that serves as the cover.
