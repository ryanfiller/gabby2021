# Alphabet Book

<img src='/images/Alphabet/alphabet-book-heroimage.png' alt='cats' class='full' />

## Challenge/Goals

The objective of this project was to create a "Map Book," or a book that demonstrated some sort of journey or story through the use of sequential images.

## Approach

The idea shown through the progression of the book is that for each letter of the alphabet you sew one additional string than was used to create the form of the previous letter. This resulted in the letter 'A' being made using 1 string sewn into the page, 'B' using 2, 'C' using 3, and so on until you reach the letter 'Z' which was created using 26 strings sewn into the final page.

## Inspiration 

This book was created as part of a series of typography-inspired book art. While other pieces in this series focused more directly on specific words and forms of communication, this piece instead focused solely on each letter form itself.

## Strategy & Solution

Using Adobe Illustrator, string positions were mapped out to create a set of all-caps, monospaced letters. These templates were then printed out and used as a guide for final placement of each string on each page. The final piece is constructed from brown mixed-media kraft paper folded and glued to create a single long accordion-folded signature that additionally holds the cover in place. The book covers are assembled from book-board, scrapbooking paper, and string. The binding is a variation of a concertina binding and pamphlet stitch, with a coptic technique across the top and bottom holes. The spine also utilizes a spine-pleat to provide extra strength and reinforce the brown kraft paper. Select spreads shown.
