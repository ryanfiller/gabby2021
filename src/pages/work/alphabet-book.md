## header

(OLD COPY) Created as part of a series of books focused on typographic exploration. Each page progresses through the alphabet using strings to create the letterforms. For each letter one more string is added. Selected spreads.

## Challenge/Goals

The objective of this project was to create a "Map Book," or a book that demonstrated some sort of journey or story through the use of sequential images.  

## Approach

The idea shown through the progression of the book is that for each letter of the alphabet you sew one additional string than was used to create the form of the previous letter. This resulted in the letter 'A' being made using 1 string sewn into the page, 'B' using 2, 'C' using 3, and so on until you reach the letter 'Z' which was created using 26 strings sewn into the final page.

## Inspiration 

This book was created as part of a series of typography-inspired book art. While other pieces in this series focused more directly on specific words and forms of communication, this piece instead focused solely on each letter form itself.
