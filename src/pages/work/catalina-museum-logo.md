## Challenge/Goals

To create a recognizable, eye-catching logo that incorporates recognizable elements from Catalina Island, where the museum is located. As part of this project, we also helped re-name the museum to Catalina Museum for Art & History in order to more clearly communicate to visitors what to expect at the museum. In addition to a logo design, we also guided the client in choosing new brand colors, typography, and also designed a new website for the museum. 

## Approach

For this website we wanted to create something fun and exciting, that also spoke to the importance of community that exists on Catalina Island. This logo is meant to connect to visitors of the island as well as local residents, and convey a sense of welcoming and belonging. The logo is designed to be modern and clean with a sense of nostalgia that connects to Catalina Island’s rich history and culture. We also wanted to represent the museum as a reliable source of interesting, high-quality exhibitions that will provide fun with family and friends.

## Inspiration 

Inspiration for the mark was pulled from around the island, including: the Spanish Mission Style Architecture of the Ada Blanche Wrigley Schreiner Building, where the museum is located; the Spanish Mission Style of the decorative tiles that can be found around the island including  in murals outside of the museum. These tiles are also available for purchase in the museum gift shop.; and natural elements, including water and yucca plant.

## Strategy 

Alongside the need for a new logo, this client also requested help with re-naming the facility. Originally “Catalina Island Museum,” we aimed to create a name that would more clearly communicate what the viewer could expect from visiting. Our team offered multiple suggestions including: Catalina Center for Art & Culture, Island Institute of Art and History, and The Catalina Collection of Art and Culture.

## Solution

Ultimately we landed on “Catalina Museum for Art & History,” and also took inspiration from a few of the presented logo options that landed us at a mark that combined both the museum building silhouette with the island tile idea. The final tiles included the wave, a yucca plant, and a Catalina backgammon design, aspects that are seen across the island, thus recognizable to and representative of the area.
